>This paper introduces a deep neural network architecture for YouTube recommendations, which is a large-scale and real-world recommendation system. The architecture consists of two components: candidate generation and ranking. The candidate generation component is responsible for selecting a small set of videos from a large pool of candidates, while the ranking component ranks these candidates to generate the final recommendations. The candidate generation component uses a deep neural network to predict the probability of a user watching a video, while the ranking component uses another deep neural network to predict the click-through rate of the videos. The paper demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly improves the performance of the YouTube recommendation system compared to traditional methods.

>This blog post, brought by Expedia Group Tech, introduces an innovative two-tower approach for candidate generation within recommendation systems. The two-tower architecture is widely utilized in recommendation systems, comprising a neural network structure consisting of two key components: the query tower and the candidate tower. The query tower encodes the user's query, while the candidate tower encodes the candidate items. These towers are then integrated to generate a score reflecting the relevance of the candidate items to the user's query. Demonstrated to be highly effective across various recommendation tasks such as click prediction, item recommendation, and ranking, the two-tower approach offers promising results. Additionally, the blog provides insightful implementation details along with dataset and code samples. [Repo](https://github.com/ExpediaGroup/two-tower-lodging-candidate-generation)
